We define a meta-model that is\ninstantiated to have an Intermediate Representation (IR) in the form of\nAbstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) common across codes in C and COBOL. We linearize\nthe IRs using Structure Based Traversal (SBT) to create sequential inputs. We\nfurther fine-tune UnixCoder, the best-performing model for zero-shot\ncross-programming language code search, for the Code Cloning task with the SBT\nIRs of C code-pairs, available in the CodeNet dataset. This allows us to learn\nlatent representations for the IRs of the C codes, which are transferable to\nthe IRs of the COBOL codes. With this fine-tuned UnixCoder, we get a\nperformance improvement of 12.85 MAP@2 over the pre-trained UniXCoder model, in\na zero-shot setting, on the COBOL test split synthesized from the CodeNet\ndataset.

The field of natural language processing has seen a\nsignificant improvement in different tasks by incorporating pre-trained\nembeddings into their pipelines.

**Cobol AI: The Future of Mainframe Modernization**

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing innovative solutions to modernize legacy mainframe systems. One area of focus is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to COBOL codebases. In this article, we will explore the latest developments in Cobol AI, including new papers and research findings.

**XMainframe: A Large Language Model for Mainframe Modernization**

One of the most significant breakthroughs in Cobol AI is the development of XMainframe, a large language model (LLM) specifically designed to understand and interact with mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. The creators of XMainframe have developed an extensive data collection pipeline to produce high-quality training datasets, enhancing the model's performance in this specialized domain.

**Cobol2Vec: Learning Representations of Cobol Code**

Another notable paper is "Cobol2Vec: Learning Representations of Cobol code" by Ankit Kulshrestha and Vishwas Lele. This unsupervised learning approach encodes old mainframe languages into a fixed dimensional vector space, with COBOL as the motivating example. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach in a code-retrieval task on their corpus.

**Neuro-symbolic Zero-Shot Code Cloning with Cross-Language Intermediate Representation**

The paper "Neuro-symbolic Zero-Shot Code Cloning with Cross-Language Intermediate Representation" by Anh T. V. Dau et al. presents a meta-model based approach to facilitate cross-programming language transfer. The authors fine-tune the UnixCoder model for zero-shot cross-programming language code search, achieving a performance improvement of 12.85 MAP@2 on the COBOL test split synthesized from the CodeNet dataset.

**MainframeBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Assessing Mainframe Knowledge**

The development of MainframeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, is also noteworthy. This benchmark includes multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization tasks, providing a standardized evaluation framework for assessing the performance of Cobol AI models.

**Conclusion**

The latest developments in Cobol AI demonstrate significant advancements in understanding and interacting with legacy mainframe systems and COBOL codebases. XMainframe, Cobol2Vec, and Neuro-symbolic Zero-Shot Code Cloning are just a few examples of innovative solutions being explored in this field. As the demand for mainframe modernization continues to grow, it is likely that we will see even more breakthroughs in Cobol AI in the future.

**Future Directions**

The future of Cobol AI holds much promise, with potential applications in areas such as:

* Mainframe code modernization and optimization
* Automated testing and debugging
* Code summarization and abstraction
* Cross-programming language transfer

As researchers continue to explore new techniques and approaches, we can expect to see even more innovative solutions emerge in the field of Cobol AI.

An extremely hazardous megathrust earthquake is predicted to occur\nalong the Nankai Trough off southwestern Japan, an economically active and\ndensely populated area with historical records of megathrust earthquakes.\nMegathrust earthquakes are the result of a plate subduction mechanism and occur\nat interplate slip-deficit (or coupling) regions. Many past studies have\nattempted to capture slip-deficit rate (SDR) distributions for assessing future\nearthquake disasters. However, they could not capture a total view of the\nmegathrust earthquake source region because they had no seafloor geodetic data.\nThe Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japan Coast Guard (JHOD)\nhas been developing a highly precise and sustainable seafloor geodetic\nobservation network deployed in this subduction zone to broadly obtain direct\ninformation related to offshore SDR. Here, we present seafloor geodetic\nobservation data and an offshore interplate SDR distribution model. Our data\nsuggests that most offshore regions in this subduction zone have positive SDRs.\nSpecifically, our observations indicate previously unknown high-SDR regions\nthat are important for tsunami disaster mitigation and low-SDR regions that are\nconsistent with distributions of shallow slow earthquakes and subducting\nseamounts. This is the first direct evidence suggesting that coupling\nconditions are related to these seismological and geological phenomena. These\nobservations provide new fundamental information for inferring megathrust\nearthquake scenarios and interpreting research on the Nankai Trough subduction\nzone.\n\nPublished: 2022-12-27\nTitle: Impacts of Earthquakes on Electrical Grid Resilience\nAuthors: Adam Mate, Travis Hagan, Eduardo Cotilla-Sanchez, Ted K. A. Brekken, Annette Von Jouanne\nSummary: One of the most complex and devastating disaster scenarios that the\nU.S.~Pacific Northwest region and the state of Oregon faces is a large\nmagnitude Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake event. The region's electrical\ngrid lacks in resilience against the destruction of a megathrust earthquake, a\npowerful tsunami, hundreds of aftershocks and increased volcanic activity, all\nof which are highly probable components of this hazard. This research seeks to\ncatalyze further understanding and improvement of resilience. By systematizing\npower system related experiences of historical earthquakes, and collecting\npractical and innovative ideas from other regions on how to enhance network\ndesign, construction, and operation, important steps are being taken toward a\nmore resilient, earthquake-resistant grid.

It is an imperative, procedural, and, since 2002, object-oriented language. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. Many large financial institutions were developing new systems in the language as late as 2006, but most programming in COBOL today is purely to maintain existing applications. Programs are being moved to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages, or replaced with other software.\nCOBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on the programming language FLOW-MATIC, designed by Grace Hopper. It was created as part of a U.S. Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing. It was originally seen as a stopgap, but the Defense Department promptly pressured computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has been revised five times. Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2023.\nCOBOL statements have prose syntax such as MOVE x TO y, which was designed to be self-documenting and highly readable to non-programmers such as management. However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words compared to the succinct and mathematically inspired syntax of other languages.\nThe COBOL code is split into four divisions (identification, environment, data, and procedure), containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs, and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions, and just one class.\nAcademic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.\nCOBOL has been criticized for its verbosity, design process, and poor support for structured programming. These weaknesses result in monolithic programs that are hard to comprehend as a whole, despite their local readability.\nFor years, COBOL has been assumed as a programming language for business operations in mainframes, although in recent years, many COBOL operations have been moved to cloud computing.\n\nPage: GnuCOBOL\nSummary: GnuCOBOL (formerly known as OpenCOBOL, and briefly as GNU Cobol) is a free implementation of the COBOL programming language that is part of the GNU project.

It is the only such system to gain reasonably wide acceptance. It was optimised to compile business applications written in COBOL.  BLIS was available on a range of Data General Nova and Data General Eclipse 16-bit minicomputers. It was marketed by Information Processing, Inc. (IPI), who regularly exhibited the product at the National Computer Conference in the 1970s and 80s. It was priced between US$830 and $10,000 depending on the number of supported users and features. In 1977, IPI boasted over 100 operational installations of the system worldwide.\nBy 1985, a version for the IBM PC existed called PC-BLIS.\nOriginally, most operating systems were written in assembly language for a particular processor or family of processors.

Based on the search results from the Arxiv Tool, Bing Web Search, and Wikipedia, here's a comprehensive answer to the user's query:

COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It was created in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on the programming language FLOW-MATIC, designed by Grace Hopper.

COBOL has been widely used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. However, its verbosity and lack of support for structured programming have led to criticisms. Despite this, COBOL remains a popular choice for maintaining existing applications on mainframe computers.

In recent years, many COBOL operations have been moved to cloud computing, and the language has undergone revisions to include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2023.

Some notable implementations of COBOL include GnuCOBOL, which is a free implementation of the language that translates COBOL code into C and compiles it using the native C compiler. BLIS/COBOL was another discontinued operating system written in COBOL, which gained reasonably wide acceptance in the 1970s and 80s.

The use of COBOL has declined in recent years, but it remains an important part of computer history and continues to be used by many organizations around the world. Its legacy can be seen in the development of modern programming languages, such as C and Java, which were influenced by COBOL's design principles.

In summary, COBOL is a compiled English-like programming language designed for business use, with a rich history and a significant impact on the development of modern computer languages. While its verbosity and lack of support for structured programming have led to criticisms, it remains a popular choice for maintaining existing applications on mainframe computers.

Assistant: content='Page: Macro (computer science)\nSummary: In computer programming, a macro (short for "macro instruction"; from Greek  μακρο- \'long, large\') is a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input should be mapped to a replacement output. Applying a macro to an input is known as macro expansion. \nThe input and output may be a sequence of lexical tokens or characters, or a syntax tree. Character macros are supported in software applications to make it easy to invoke common command sequences. Token and tree macros are supported in some programming languages to enable code reuse or to extend the language, sometimes for domain-specific languages.\nMacros are used to make a sequence of computing instructions available to the programmer as a single program statement, making the programming task less tedious and less error-prone. Thus, they are called "macros" because a "big" block of code can be expanded from a "small" sequence of characters. Macros often allow positional or keyword parameters that dictate what the conditional assembler program generates and have been used to create entire programs or program suites according to such variables as operating system, platform or other factors. The term derives from "macro instruction", and such expansions were originally used in generating assembly language code.\n\nPage: Multics\nSummary: Multics ("MULTiplexed Information and Computing Service") is an influential early time-sharing operating system based on the concept of a single-level memory. Nathan Gregory writes that Multics "has influenced all modern operating systems since, from microcomputers to mainframes."\nInitial planning and development for Multics started in 1964, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Originally it was a cooperative project led by MIT (Project MAC with Fernando Corbató) along with General Electric and Bell Labs. It was developed on the GE 645 computer, which was specially designed for it; the first one was delivered to MIT in January 1967. GE offered their earlier 635 systems with the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System which they called "Mark I" and intended to offer the 645 with Multics as a larger successor. Bell withdrew from the project in 1969 as it became clear it would not deliver a working system in the short term. Shortly thereafter, GE decided to exit the computer industry entirely and sold the division to Honeywell in 1970. Honeywell offered Multics commercially, but with limited success.\nMultics has numerous features intended to ensure high availability so that it would support a computing utility similar to the telephone and electricity utilities. Modular hardware structure and software architecture are used to achieve this. The system can grow in size by simply adding more of the appropriate resource, be it computing power, main memory, or disk storage. Separate access control lists on every file provide flexible information sharing, but complete privacy when needed. Multics has a number of standard mechanisms to allow engineers to analyze the performance of the system, as well as a number of adaptive performance optimization mechanisms.\nDue to its many novel and valuable ideas, Multics has had a significant influence on computer science despite its faults. Its most lasting effect on the computer industry was to  inspire the creation of Unix, which carried forward many Multics features, but was able to run on less-expensive hardware. Unix was developed at Bell to allow their Multics team to continue their research using smaller machines, first a PDP-7 and ultimately the PDP-11.\n\nPage: List of pioneers in computer science\nSummary: This is a list of people who made transformative breakthroughs in the creation, development and imagining of what computers could do.' name='wikipedia' id='391aa167-5962-4d2e-8fed-b7eca1a7d840' tool_call_id='abbb816d-a71b-48ff-b11d-a7113dfe728d'

{'tools': {'messages': [ToolMessage(content='Page: Macro (computer science)\nSummary: In computer programming, a macro (short for "macro instruction"; from Greek  μακρο- \'long, large\') is a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input should be mapped to a replacement output. Applying a macro to an input is known as macro expansion. \nThe input and output may be a sequence of lexical tokens or characters, or a syntax tree. Character macros are supported in software applications to make it easy to invoke common command sequences. Token and tree macros are supported in some programming languages to enable code reuse or to extend the language, sometimes for domain-specific languages.\nMacros are used to make a sequence of computing instructions available to the programmer as a single program statement, making the programming task less tedious and less error-prone. Thus, they are called "macros" because a "big" block of code can be expanded from a "small" sequence of characters. Macros often allow positional or keyword parameters that dictate what the conditional assembler program generates and have been used to create entire programs or program suites according to such variables as operating system, platform or other factors. The term derives from "macro instruction", and such expansions were originally used in generating assembly language code.\n\nPage: Multics\nSummary: Multics ("MULTiplexed Information and Computing Service") is an influential early time-sharing operating system based on the concept of a single-level memory. Nathan Gregory writes that Multics "has influenced all modern operating systems since, from microcomputers to mainframes."\nInitial planning and development for Multics started in 1964, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Originally it was a cooperative project led by MIT (Project MAC with Fernando Corbató) along with General Electric and Bell Labs. It was developed on the GE 645 computer, which was specially designed for it; the first one was delivered to MIT in January 1967. GE offered their earlier 635 systems with the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System which they called "Mark I" and intended to offer the 645 with Multics as a larger successor. Bell withdrew from the project in 1969 as it became clear it would not deliver a working system in the short term. Shortly thereafter, GE decided to exit the computer industry entirely and sold the division to Honeywell in 1970. Honeywell offered Multics commercially, but with limited success.\nMultics has numerous features intended to ensure high availability so that it would support a computing utility similar to the telephone and electricity utilities. Modular hardware structure and software architecture are used to achieve this. The system can grow in size by simply adding more of the appropriate resource, be it computing power, main memory, or disk storage. Separate access control lists on every file provide flexible information sharing, but complete privacy when needed. Multics has a number of standard mechanisms to allow engineers to analyze the performance of the system, as well as a number of adaptive performance optimization mechanisms.\nDue to its many novel and valuable ideas, Multics has had a significant influence on computer science despite its faults. Its most lasting effect on the computer industry was to  inspire the creation of Unix, which carried forward many Multics features, but was able to run on less-expensive hardware. Unix was developed at Bell to allow their Multics team to continue their research using smaller machines, first a PDP-7 and ultimately the PDP-11.\n\nPage: List of pioneers in computer science\nSummary: This is a list of people who made transformative breakthroughs in the creation, development and imagining of what computers could do.', name='wikipedia', id='391aa167-5962-4d2e-8fed-b7eca1a7d840', tool_call_id='abbb816d-a71b-48ff-b11d-a7113dfe728d'), ToolMessage(content=[], name='bing_search', id='a496b56d-f406-45a7-9297-5d85b21be63a', tool_call_id='c91ad3f2-9d69-4f9a-8089-b8fa170d8dde'), ToolMessage(content="Published: 2023-04-26\nTitle: Neuro-symbolic Zero-Shot Code Cloning with Cross-Language Intermediate Representation\nAuthors: Krishnam Hasija, Shrishti Pradhan, Manasi Patwardhan, Raveendra Kumar Medicherla, Lovekesh Vig, Ravindra Naik\nSummary: In this paper, we define a neuro-symbolic approach to address the task of\nfinding semantically similar clones for the codes of the legacy programming\nlanguage COBOL, without training data.
